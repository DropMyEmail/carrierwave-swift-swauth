# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle
/bundler_stubs

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
*.log
/log/*.log
/tmp
/spec/reports
/coverage

*.DS_Store
*.swp
*.swo
.rvmrc
